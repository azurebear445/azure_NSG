### 1. Alignment with Azure Resource Group Module Standards
**Purpose:** Ensure consistency across all Azure Terraform modules

**Changes:**
- Updated naming conventions to match established Azure RG module patterns
- Modified namespace calculation to include environment and location
- Adjusted NSG naming format: `{namespace}-{environment}-{location}-nsg-{random}`
- Example: `myapp-prod-eastus2-nsg-5c58e0`

### 2. Expanded Regional Support
**Purpose:** Support additional Azure deployment regions

**Changes:**
- Added third region support (northcentralus) to existing two-region setup
- Updated region mapping:
  - Region-01: eastus
  - Region-02: eastus2
  - Region-03: northcentralus (receives common rules only)
- Implemented location validation to restrict deployments to approved regions

### 3. Enterprise Security Rules Control System
**Purpose:** Give teams flexibility in applying security rules

**Changes:**
- Added control variables for default and opt-in ESRs
- Default ESRs (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 08): Applied automatically unless explicitly disabled
- Opt-in ESRs (06, 07, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13): Applied only when explicitly enabled
- Teams can now choose which security rules apply to their NSGs

### 4. Provider Version Updates
**Purpose:** Maintain compatibility with latest Azure provider

**Changes:**
- Updated AzureRM provider from version 3.0 to 4.0
- Ensures access to latest Azure features and bug fixes

### 5. Module Interface Simplification
**Purpose:** Simplify module usage and reduce required inputs

**Changes:**
- Removed unnecessary `name` variable from module interface
- Streamlined variable requirements for easier module adoption

### 6. Terminology Standardization
**Purpose:** Use Azure-appropriate terminology consistently

**Changes:**
- Renamed all references from "Enterprise Security Groups" to "Enterprise Security Rules"
- Updated file naming: esg-*.tf → esr-*.tf (13 files)
- Aligns with Azure terminology (NSG rules, not security groups)

### 7. Code Quality Improvements
**Purpose:** Improve code maintainability and readability

**Changes:**
- Simplified verbose comments throughout all files
- Removed legacy AWS-specific references and documentation
- Cleaned up comment formatting for professional appearance
- Updated region references to reflect current Azure locations

### 8. Rule Description Handling
**Purpose:** Allow teams flexibility in documenting their rules

**Changes:**
- Modified default behavior for user-defined rules without descriptions
- Changed from auto-populating description to leaving blank when not provided
- Enterprise rules maintain their predefined descriptions

### 9. Conditional Rule Application Logic
**Purpose:** Optimize rule deployment based on location

**Changes:**
- Implemented location-based conditional merging for region-specific rules
- Ensures only relevant rules are applied to each region
- Reduces unnecessary rule deployment and improves clarity

### 10. Example Configurations
**Purpose:** Provide clear usage patterns for teams

**Changes:**
- Created two example configurations:
  - `default/`: Shows basic usage with default ESRs
  - `with-additional-rules/`: Demonstrates enabling opt-in ESRs
- Both examples include Resource Group module integration
- Placeholder files for backend, providers, and variable configuration



#### **Region Mapping**
- Updated supported regions from three regions to two regions:
  - **Region-01:** eastus
  - **Region-02:** northcentralus
- Removed Region-03 concept entirely







1. Region Configuration Update
Purpose: Align with current Azure region strategy
Changes:

Updated supported regions: Region-01 (eastus), Region-02 (northcentralus)
Updated all ESR files with new region mapping
Updated locals.tf and variables.tf with new region configuration
Updated location validation to reflect current regions
