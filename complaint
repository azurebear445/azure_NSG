"Regarding the source_address_prefixes suggestion - I don't think consolidating rules makes sense for this module for a few reasons:

Each ESR file is independent with separate opt-in/opt-out controls - ESR-01 through ESR-05 and ESR-08 use enable_enterprise_security_rules, while ESR-06 through ESR-13 have individual enable flags (enable_rubrik_backup, enable_db_admin_access, etc.). Combining rules across ESRs would break this granular control.
This follows the same logic from when you asked about merging all default ESR files into one - I said no because it would create a massive, unmaintainable file. The same principle applies here - keeping rules separate by ESR maintains clarity, modularity, and independent control.
We're replicating AWS Security Groups 1:1 - The AWS rules are structured this way, so Azure should match for easier maintenance and parity.
Rules sharing the same port serve different business purposes - ServiceNow port 22 vs Rubrik port 22 are conceptually different even if they use the same port.

I'm keeping the current structure with source_address_prefix (singular) to maintain the 1:1 mapping from AWS."






"I appreciate the suggestion to flatten directly in the for_each to make the translation more direct. I see the benefit of reducing the intermediate step.
However, I'd like to keep the current locals approach if that's okay because:

Easier debugging and validation - Having the assembled rules in a named local makes it easier to verify which rules are being included during testing and troubleshooting
Cleaner resource block - The main.tf resource definition stays focused on resource creation rather than rule assembly logic
Consistent with the flatten pattern - We're already using flatten in locals for user-defined rules processing, so keeping this pattern consistent makes the codebase more predictable
Separation of concerns - locals.tf handles the 'what rules to include' logic, while main.tf handles the 'how to create them' logic

The current approach works well and I think it'll be easier to maintain as we add features. Does this sound reasonable, or would you prefer I refactor it?"


"Regarding the diagnostic settings - I initially added this to create Log Analytics monitoring for the NSG, but discovered that Azure Policy automatically configures diagnostic settings for NSGs in our environment.
When the module tries to create its own diagnostic setting, it conflicts with the policy-managed one. The policy configuration takes precedence and overrides any module-created settings.
I'm removing this code block entirely since:

Azure Policy already handles NSG diagnostic settings automatically
Users don't need to create their own Log Analytics workspace
This simplifies the module and removes potential conflicts
One less thing for users to configure

The NSG will still have diagnostic settings enabled - just managed by Azure Policy rather than the module."



Done. Split into separate resources: icmp_from_cidrs, tcp_from_cidrs, udp_from_cidrs, tcp_from_asgs, udp_from_asgs, icmp_to_cidrs, tcp_to_cidrs, udp_to_cidrs, tcp_to_asgs, udp_to_asgs.
