"I don't think consolidating rules using source_address_prefixes makes sense for this module because:

Each ESR file is independent with separate opt-in/opt-out controls (enable_rubrik_backup, enable_db_admin_access, etc.)
Combining rules across ESRs would break the granular enable/disable functionality
We're replicating AWS Security Groups 1:1 - the AWS rules are separate, so Azure should match
Rules that happen to share the same port serve different business purposes (ServiceNow vs Rubrik vs SolarWinds)

Consolidation might make sense within a single ESR file if duplicate ports exist, but not across different ESRs. Should I keep the current structure?"
