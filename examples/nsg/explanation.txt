In AWS, tag-based ESG application is handled by AWS Firewall Manager (FMS), which automatically attaches security groups to EC2 instances based on resource tags like ops:servicenow_ingress = "true".

Our Azure module bakes all enterprise rules directly into the NSG. The filtering happens at deployment time based on region (eastus2 vs centralus), not tags.
